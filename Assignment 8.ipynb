After all, that is what it means to be human. However, despite all this, the movie does not convince me that Paul TRULY believes he is the Kwisatz Haderach. Even in the end, when he gains control of it all, it still feels that he is doing it only to avenge his father. He has taken the Water of Life, tapped into an omnipotent consciousness and convinced all around him, but he has not convinced HIMSELF. Like Stilgar, we all see the SIGNS, except the ONE himself. I'm not sure if this is because of his love for Chani, who fights against the prophecy with every fiber of her being; or his hate for the Bene Gesserit and their calculated manipulations of mankind's actions and beliefs.

On Arrakis, Stilgar's Fremen troops, including Paul and his pregnant mother, Lady Jessica, overcome a Harkonnen patrol. When Jessica and Paul reach Sietch Tabr, some Fremen suspect they are spies, while Stilgar and others see signs of the prophecy that a mother and son from the \"Outer World\" will bring prosperity to Arrakis.\n","Stilgar tells Jessica that Sietch Tabr's Reverend Mother is dying and that Jessica must succeed her by drinking the Water of Life—a poison fatal for males and untrained women. Jessica transmutes and survives the poison, inheriting the memories of all the past Reverend Mothers. The liquid also prematurely awakens the mind of her unborn daughter, Alia, allowing Jessica to communicate with her. They agree to focus on convincing the more skeptical northern Fremen of the prophecy. Chani and her friend, Shishakli, believe the prophecy was fabricated to manipulate the Fremen. However, she begins to respect Paul after he declares that he only intends to fight alongside the Fremen, not to rule them.\n","Paul and Chani fall in love as Paul immerses himself in Fremen culture: learning their language, becoming a Fedaykin fighter, riding a sandworm, and raiding against Harkonnen spice operations. Paul adopts the Fremen names \"Usul\" and \"Muad'Dib\". Due to the devastating spice raids, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen replaces his nephew, Glossu Rabban, as Arrakis's ruler with his more cunning yet psychotic younger nephew, Feyd-Rautha. Lady Margot Fenring, a Bene Gesserit, is sent to evaluate Feyd-Rautha as a prospective Kwisatz Haderach and to secure his genetic lineage.\n","Jessica travels south to unite with Fremen fundamentalists who believe in the prophecy. Paul remains in the north, fearful that his visions of a holy war will occur if he goes south as a messiah. During another raid on a spice harvester, Paul reunites with Gurney Halleck, with each having presumed the other dead since their separation. Gurney leads Paul to the hidden atomic stockpile of House Atreides. Feyd-Rautha unleashes a devastating attack on the northern Fremen, including Sietch Tabr, forcing Paul and the survivors to journey south. Shishakli remains and Feyd-Rautha executes her. Upon arrival, Paul drinks the Water of Life and falls into a coma. This angers Chani, but she is compelled by Jessica to mix her tears with the liquid, which awakens him. Paul now has clairvoyance across space and time; he envisions an adult Alia on water-filled Arrakis, perceiving a singular path to victory among all possible futures, and discovering that Jessica is the Baron's daughter.\n","Paul meets with a southern Fremen war council, galvanizing the crowd by demonstrating his ability to discern their deepest thoughts. He declares himself the Lisan al Gaib and sends a challenge to Shaddam, who arrives on Arrakis with Irulan and the Sardaukar. As Shaddam chastises the Harkonnens for their failures, the Fremen launch an offensive using atomics and sandworms to overpower the Sardaukar. Paul executes the Baron, capturing Shaddam and his entourage. Meanwhile, Gurney intercepts and kills a fleeing Rabban.\n","Paul challenges Shaddam for the throne and, to Chani's dismay, demands to marry Irulan. Previously summoned by the Baron, the Great Houses arrive in orbit. Paul threatens to destroy the spice fields with atomics if they intervene. Feyd-Rautha volunteers to be Shaddam's champion, but Paul kills him in a duel. Irulan agrees to Paul's request for marriage on the condition that her father lives. Shaddam reluctantly surrenders, kneeling, and kisses Paul's signet ring. When the Great Houses reject Paul's ascendancy, he orders the Fremen to attack the orbiting fleet. As Stilgar leads the Fremen onto the captured Sardaukar ships, Jessica and Alia reflect on the beginning of Paul's holy war.
